A computer program or routine is described as reentrant if it can be safely called again before its previous invocation has been completed (i.e it can be safely executed concurrently). To be reentrant, a computer program or routine:

Must hold no static (or global) non-constant data.
Must not return the address to static (or global) non-constant data.
Must work only on the data provided to it by the caller.
Must not rely on locks to singleton resources.
Must not modify its own code (unless executing in its own unique thread storage)
Must not call non-reentrant computer programs or routines.
